Usage

    Open any HScript code and choose HScript using menu at the right bottom corner
    of the editor. If you don't want to change from Batch to HScript every time
    you open file with `.cmd` extension, there is "Open all with current extension
    as..." action in the same menu.

    When you start to type expression function name, it will prompt you with
    suggestions. You can choose one and use `Tab` and `Shift+Tab` keys to navigate
    back and forth.

    To show docs for the function:
        Tools → Command Pallette → HScript: Show Documentation for Function Under Cursor
        Shortcut: "Ctrl+Alt+D".

    For the rest, check Sublime Text Documentation, it has many small features
